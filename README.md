Please navigate to the Notebook director and click on one of the .ipynb files to view the analysis. Unless you are interested in learning how to pull down outputs for climate models that live in the cloud, you might be able to skip the first notebook, titled "01.Download_Climate_Model_Outputs". Much of the analysis of the data is in the second notebook "02.Gumbo_Weather_Analysis".  The directory "Data" contains all the datasets used to make the analysis. The directory "Tables" has the outputs used to make the charts in the article.
